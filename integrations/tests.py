Tests
- This file contains the test cases for the application.
- It is used to ensure that the application behaves as expected by testing
  various components, including models, views, and forms.
- Each test case should be independent and cover specific functionality
  to verify that the application is working correctly.

Example:
    from django.test import TestCase
    from .models import Book

    class BookModelTest(TestCase):
        def test_string_representation(self):
            book = Book(title="Sample Book")
            self.assertEqual(str(book), book.title)
